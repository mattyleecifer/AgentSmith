AgentSmith Notes

Bugs:
- Requestfunction sometimes spams like a million requests at once - figure out why
- keeping api key in folder won't work if you are depending on it being in anything other than the default folder - you must specify a key for all production agents - not sure if bug


Change notes:
- completely revamped code and UI - worth re-reading README for new features
